This paper presents machine learning models built from scratch to classify breast cancer tumours. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) are implemented without relying on high-level programming interfaces. The models are evaluated using various performance metrics, revealing that MLP slightly outperforms SVM for this task. These findings suggest that MLP may be a more effective approach for breast cancer tumour classification, while also raising that interpretability is one of the limitations of both methods.
