This paper presents machine learning models built from scratch to classify breast cancer tumours. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) are implemented without relying on high-level programming interfaces. The models' performance is evaluated using various performance metrics, revealing that MLP outperforms SVM for this task. [add a conclusion of the conclusion here]
